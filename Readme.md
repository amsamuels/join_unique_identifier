To test dev or live you will need to change some things
if you are testing dev you will need to change the all_files varible to math the path to the folder. The same changes will need to be made for testing live
if you want to view the output in seperate files you will need to change the output varible filename before you run the code for each test
To test the solution in your terminal run python main.py
You can find the run time logged in the terminal
